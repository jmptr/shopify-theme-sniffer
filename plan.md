# Shopify Theme Sniffer

A browser extension for making backups of a Shopify Theme.

## Backup Utility

When the user browses to website, it looks for cues that it is a Shopify Theme. If it is a confirmed Shopify Theme, the extension lights up. The user can then start a process that uses the Shopify storefront API or the Shopify REST API to make a backup of the storefront's data using IndexedDB.

## Reporting Dashboard

The extension has a dashboard page that shows the list of storefronts backed up and a count of the products and collections backed up for each storefront.

## Log Page

The extension has a log page that shows the activity that the extension has been doing in order to make the backups.
